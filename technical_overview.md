# Subway-Tech-Analysis: Technical & Data Overview

The purpose of this document is to explains general methodology of how data was aggregated and transformed. 

*Target Audience: Technical*

<hr>

## In general...

We had 4 main data sources that we were looking to aggregate and base our recomendations off of:

a. **NYC Subway Volume** - Data acquired from MTA here ____.
b. **Subway Location** - Data acquired from __ here.
c. **Tech Centers Location** - Data scraped from NYC Digitial here.
d. **Population Income per location** - Data acquired from the US census here ___.

For the most part, all data sources needed to be cleaned and parsed to get it into our intended format which **CartoDB** would be able to accept.

## NYC Subway Volume

 1. Downlaod Data from the MTA
?? Convert continuous sum to different amount

 2. Clean up MTA data and get into 
	* Remove values which are too high
	
	* Account for off hours time
	* sdgdg
	* sdgdg
 3. sdfsd
 
Additional Steps:

* Integrate script to download all subway files and merge them together
